When entering an invalid password, it is possible to have a single red asterisk marking the Password field while the Confirm Password field is marked by two red asterisks. The Password field, as far I have seen, is unable to have more than one red asterisk marking it. 
	-In Password field, enter an invalid password 
	-In Confirm Password field, enter an invalid password that does not match Password field. 
	-Confirm Password field will receive an asterisk for being invalid and another for not matching


Password failed attempt counter incremeted twice because failed password attempt is increased once during validation method call and again after validation method has returned a false value
	-Lines 155-159 in Login.ascx.cs
	-ValidateUser and UpdatePasswordAttempt methods in Customer.cs


Password age is checked in
